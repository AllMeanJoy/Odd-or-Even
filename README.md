# Odd-or-Even-Game
Ask a user for a number between 0-1000.
When the user gives you the number, you check if it's odd or even and then you print a message letting them know.

prompt: What number are you thinking of? (or something similar)
input: 25
output: That's an odd number, give me another? (or something similar)

I saw this game at freecodecamp.org and added my own twist too it.
Bonus: Add a error message for numbers outside the range of 0 and 1000.
